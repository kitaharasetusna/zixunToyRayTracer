# zixunToyRayTracer
my toyRayTracer

In this project I followed awsome resources from [Quantitve Bytes](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page)  
and do everthing from scratch after watching it(not copying/ pasting, but write in my own way).
I plan to add some new algorithms after finishing the basic framework of this;

If one want use this project, they should simply use make command , and make clean to clean all unnecessary object files
